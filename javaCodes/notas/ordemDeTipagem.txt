When it comes to writing information such as type, visibility, and other details for methods, attributes, and classes in Java, there is a specific order to follow. Let's go through it step by step.

For classes:
1. Class visibility modifier: `public`, `protected`, or `private`.
2. Access modifiers: `abstract`, `final`, or `static`.
3. The keyword `class` followed by the class name.
4. Inheritance (if applicable): `extends` followed by the superclass name.
5. Implemented interfaces (if applicable): `implements` followed by interface names.

Here's an example of a class declaration following the order:

```java
public abstract class MyClass extends SuperClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {
    // Class members go here
}
```

For attributes (instance variables):
1. Attribute visibility modifier: `public`, `protected`, or `private`.
2. Access modifiers: `static`, `final`, or `volatile`.
3. Attribute type.
4. Attribute name.
5. Initialization (if applicable).

Here's an example of an attribute declaration following the order:

```java
private static final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
```

For methods:
1. Method visibility modifier: `public`, `protected`, or `private`.
2. Access modifiers: `abstract`, `final`, `static`, or `synchronized`.
3. Method return type.
4. Method name.
5. Method parameters (if applicable).
6. Method exceptions (if applicable).

Here's an example of a method declaration following the order:

```java
public void doSomething(int parameter) throws IOException {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

It's important to note that some parts are optional depending on the specific requirements of your code. Additionally, the order I've provided is a general guideline, but there might be exceptions based on coding conventions or specific project requirements.

By following these guidelines, you ensure consistency and readability in your code. It helps other developers, including your future self, understand and navigate your codebase more easily.

Keep up the great work in your Java studies, and feel free to ask if you have any more questions!
